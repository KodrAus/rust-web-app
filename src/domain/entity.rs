/*!
Defines the constraints that all entities must satisfy.

This trait is really just a marker for ensuring all entities follow a basic structure.
It's a checklist: the first thing to do when creating a new entity is to implement this trait and fill in the blanks.
Any changes to entities that should be consistent can be added here.
