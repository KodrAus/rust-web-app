/*!
An example Rust web application.

The project is split into a few main parts:

- `api`: the rocket web application where the app is configured and hosted
- `domain`: the core app logic
- `store`: a little transactional datastore implementation

Most of the `domain` module is `pub(restricted)`, so these docs only show the items
that can be consumed by the application. Refer to the source for a fuller picture of what's in there.
You can also build the docs with private items visible to explore everything:

```text
cargo doc --document-private-items
```
